		<h2>Spaceship Game</h2>
		<h3>Description and Overview</h3>
			<p> This <strong>spaceship game (press for touchscreen version)</strong> is a boring game that I made. It really isn't that great.
				But, as this is the first game I have ever programmed, I like it. In this game, you fly around a small solar system. No enemies yet.
				You can crash into the sun, planets, or asteroids. Although the game isn't much, I put a lot of work into it. The cockpit took a long
				time to design.</p>
	
	<h3>Basic game controls</h3>
		<p>The controls to the normal (computer) version of the game are simple.<br><br>
			A, or LEFT - turns left<br><br>
			D, or RIGHT - turns right<br><br>
			S, or DOWN - pulls up<br><br>
			W, or UP - dive<br><br>
			F - fires the gun<br><br>
			SHIFT - rocket engine (booster)
